CS30 CAPSTONE PROJECT PROPOSAL

Premise:
A series of brain games based off of Human Benchmark, where 
each tests the cognitive abilities of the player. While 
Human Benchmark has many brain games, this project will focus 
heavily on the development of the Sequence Memory Game. If 
time allows, this project may also include a Number Memory game,
and a Verbal Memory game. 

Required Features:
This game obviously needs:
1.1. A method to randomize the sequence of squares being lit up
1.2. A way to increase difficulty of the sequences after certain levels
1.3. A way to check if the user inputted order is the same as the generated sequence, 
rather than just clicking the correct squares that light up.

Optional Features:
This game would be ideal if it had:
2.1. Sounds when the sequence is being shown per square.
2.1.1. Therefore, it should also have sound when the user clicks a square.
2.3. A menu screen that could set the base for adding other games.

*******************
2.4. A health system, where the user has the opportunity to make multiple mistakes before losing.
This means the base program would not have this, and the user would get reset if they mess up.
********************

2.6. The ability to save progress.


As of 1.13.2025, the required features work perfectly (1.1, 1.2, 1.3). 

As of 1.13.2025, the following optional features work: (NONE).
  A health system (2.4) is not in the spirit of this memory game, so this feature will likely not be implemented.
  Instead, the sequencing function has been made more advanced, in order to compensate for this.

FEATURE IDEA (1.13.2025): 
UI: have clicked squares "float" above the grid on hover, allowing for a "dip" effect when clicked.
      make text better; ease each text back to top of screen, then ease back down next time.
      keep a score in a corner, tracking
